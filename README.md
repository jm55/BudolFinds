## Budol Finds

Our proposed web application is for shoppers to share their bought items to
recommend to fellow shoppers. The idea was taken from the private Facebook group,
Home Buddies, with over 3 million members. The Facebook group’s posts cover
different topics and purposes, however, the group decided to take on the idea of
sharing “budol finds”, which are items that were bought and enjoyed by home
shoppers. 

The web application’s main aim is to provide a platform of consolidated
“budol finds” for shoppers to make sharing and finding items easier, rather than a
general Facebook group page. Through the web application, shoppers are given a
better shopping experience as items they wish to buy are items suggested by fellow
shoppers. It also makes it easier to shop as items are organized by categories and
provided with a link or destination on where it can be bought.
The web application would require a user to create an account before they are
able to share their finds. The user can then create a post containing what they bought,
where to find it, and a media attachment of the item. The website would have a user
page, home page/timeline, and different pages organized by item category (e.g.:
‘Women’s Clothing’, ‘Men’s Clothing’, ‘Home’, ‘Pet Supplies’, etc.).

### Web App Description
The web application was inspired by a private Facebook group called Home Buddies, which at the time of the web app's creation has over 3 million members. The Facebook group’s posts cover
different topics and purposes, however, the group decided to take on the idea of
sharing “budol finds”, which are items that were bought and enjoyed by home
shoppers. The web application’s main aim is to provide a platform of consolidated
“budol finds” for shoppers to make sharing and finding items easier, rather than a
general Facebook group page. Through the web application, shoppers are given a
better shopping experience as items they wish to buy are items suggested by fellow
shoppers. It also makes it easier to shop as items are organized by categories and
provided with a link or destination on where it can be bought.
The web application would require a user to create an account before they are
able to share their finds. The user can then create a post containing what they bought,
where to find it, and a media attachment of the item. The website would have a user
page, home page/timeline, and different pages organized by item category (e.g.:
‘Women’s Clothing’, ‘Men’s Clothing’, ‘Home’, ‘Pet Supplies’, etc.).
